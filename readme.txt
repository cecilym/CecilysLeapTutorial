This tutorial is suitable for anyone interested in developing for the Leap Motion Controller using the JavaScript API. It is based on the sample JavaScript Tutorial provided with the Leap Motion Controller SDK, but I made it more accessible to beginners by keeping the script within the working HTML page and explaining important HTML and JavaScript concepts along the way. Each of the tutorial stages contains an in depth portion called cecilys_leap_js_tutorial, a blank HTML page called index.html, and an HTML page illustrating how your code should look at the end of the stage called indexFinished.html. 

Beginner Instructions:
Start by opening the entire cecilysLeapTutorial folder in a text editor such as the Sublime Text 2. Navigate to the stage1 folder and open cecilys_leap_js_tutorial.txt. Also open index.html in your text editor. When new concepts are introduced in cecilys_leap_js_tutorial.txt (cecilys_leap_js_tutorial.html in later stages), practice typing them in index.html. At the end of the stage, compare your results with indexFinished.html. At the end of each stage, you can open indexFinished.html in a browser such as Google Chrome to see how your code looks live. By stage8 indexFinished.html, if your Leap Motion Controller is plugged in, you will see real time controller data displayed on the page in the browser.
